# ROM Properties Page shell extension

This shell extension adds a few nice features to file browsers for managing
video game ROM and disc images:
* Image thumbnails, using either images built into the ROM or an external
  database of scans.
* Property page with information about the ROM image.

This is a work in progress; feedback is encouraged. To leave feedback, you
can file an issue on GitHub, or visit the Gens/GS IRC channel:

## Quick Install Instructions

Currently, the ROM Properties Page shell extension is compatible with the
following platforms:
* KDE 4.x
* KDE Frameworks 5.x
* Windows XP (and later)

### Linux

On Ubuntu, you will need build-essential and the following development packages:
* All: cmake libcurl-dev nettle-dev zlib1g-dev libpng-dev
* KDE 4.x: libqt4-dev kdelibs5-dev
* KDE 5.x: qtbase5-dev kio-dev

Clone the repository, then:
* cd rom-properties
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
* make
* sudo make install
* (KDE 4.x) kbuildsycoca4 --noincremental
* (KDE 5.x) kbuildsycoca5 --noincremental

NOTE: Neither KDE 4.x nor KDE 5.x will find the rom-properties plugin if it's
installed in /usr/local/. It must be installed in /usr/.

After installing, restart Dolphin, then right-click a supported ROM or disc image
and click Properties. If everything worked correctly, you should see a
"ROM Properties" tab that shows information from the ROM header.

### Windows

The Windows version requires one of the following compilers: (minimum versions)
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 with the Windows 7 SDK
* gcc-4.5 with MinGW-w64
  * The MinGW build is currently somewhat broken, so MSVC is preferred.
    (The property page icon doesn't show up sometimes for Nintendo DS
     ROMs, and XP theming doesn't work because MinGW-w64 doesn't support
     isolation awareness for COM components.)

You will also need to install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/), since the
project uses the CMake build system.

Clone the repository, then open an MSVC or MinGW command prompt and run the
following commands from your rom-properties repository directory:
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
* cd src\win32
* regsvr32 rom-properties.dll

Caveats:
* Registering rom-properties.dll hard-codes the full path in the registry.
  Moving the file will break the registration.
* If building with MSVC, you may need to specify -G "NMake Makefiles".
* CMake does not support building for multiple architectures at once. For
  Win64, a 64-bit build will work for Windows Explorer, but will not work
  in any 32-bit programs.
* Due to file extension conflicts, the Windows version currently only
  registers itself for a subset of extensions. This does not include
  .iso or .bin. A future update may change extension registration to
  handle "all files".

## Current OS Feature Support Level

|     Platform     | Properties Tab | Thumbnails | Icons |
|------------------|:--------------:|:----------:|:-----:|
| KDE 4.x          |       Yes      |     Yes    |  N/A  |
| KDE 5.x          |       Yes      |     Yes    |  N/A  |
| XFCE (Thunar)    |       No       |     No     |  N/A  |
| GNOME (Nautilus) |       No       |     No     |  N/A  |
| Windows          |       Yes      |     Yes    |  Yes  |

Notes:
* The KDE 4.x and 5.x plugins share most of the code. The only differences
  are in the plugin interface (due to automoc issues) and the .desktop file.
* The XFCE and GNOME file managers both use a similar interface for generating
  thumbnails, but with a different metadata file. Hence, once thumbnail support
  is implemented for one of them, it will also be implemented for the other.
* Windows supports separate icon and thumbnail handlers, which is why a
  separate "icon" feature is listed. Linux desktop environments generally
  use the file's MIME type to determine the icon, so custom icons are always
  implemented using the thumbnail interface.

## Current ROM Feature Support Level

|           System          | Properties Tab | Internal Images | External Scans |
|:-------------------------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| Sega Mega Drive           |       Yes      |       N/A       |       No       |
| Nintendo DS(i)            |       Yes      |       Icon      |       No       |
| Nintendo GameCube         |       Yes      |        No       |      Disc      |
| Nintendo GameCube Saves   |       Yes      |       Yes       |       N/A      |
| Nintendo Wii              |       Yes      |        No       |      Disc      |
| Nintendo Game Boy (Color) |       Yes      |       N/A       |       No       |
| Nintendo Game Boy Advance |       Yes      |       N/A       |       No       |

Notes:
* Internal image refers to artwork contained within the ROM and/or disc image.
  These images are typically displayed on the system's main menu prior to
  starting the game.
  * "N/A" here means the ROM or disc image doesn't have this feature.
  * "No" indicates that the feature is present but not currently implemented.
* External scans refers to scans from an external database, such as GameTDB.com
  for GameCube and Wii.
  * "No" indicates no database is currently available for this system.
  * Anything else indicates what types of images are available.

There will eventually be a configuration window for setting which image
will be used for thumbnails (and icons on Windows).

## ROM Formats Supported

* Sega Mega Drive: Plain binary (\*.gen, \*.bin), Super Magic Drive (\*.smd)
* Nintendo DS(i): Decrypted (\*.nds)
* Nintendo GameCube: 1:1 disc image (\*.iso, \*.gcm) [including DiscEx-shrunken images],
  CISO disc image (\*.ciso), TGC embedded disc image (\*.tgc), save files (\*.gci, \*.gcs, \*.sav)
* Nintendo Wii: 1:1 disc image (\*.iso, \*.gcm), WBFS disc image (\*.wbfs),
  CISO disc image (\*.ciso)
* Nintendo Game Boy: Plain binary (\*.gb, \*.gbc, \*.sgb)
* Nintendo Game Boy Advance: Plain binary (\*.gba, \*.agb, \*.mb)

Some file types are not currently registered on Windows due to conflicts with
well-known file types, e.g. \*.bin, \*.iso, and \*.mb.

## External Media Downloads

Currently, two systems (GameCube and Wii) support the use of external media
scans through GameTDB.com. The current release of the ROM Properties Page shell
extension will always attempt to download images from GameTDB.com if thumbnail
preview is enabled and a valid GameCube or Wii disc image is present in the
current directory. An option to disable automatic downloads will be added in
a future version.

Downloaded images are cached to the following directory:
* Linux: `~/.cache/rom-properties/`
* Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\rom-properties\cache`

The directory structure matches the source site, so e.g. a disc image of
Super Smash Bros. Brawl would be downloaded to
`~/.cache/rom-properties/wii/disc/US/RSBE01.png`. Note that if the download
fails for any reason, a 0-byte dummy file will be placed in the cache,
which tells the shell extension not to attempt to download the file again.
[FIXME: If the download fails due to no network connectivity, it shouldn't
do this.]

If you have an offline copy of the GameTDB image database, you can copy
it to the ROM Properties Page cache directory to allow the extension to
use the pre-downloaded version instead of downloading images as needed.

## Decryption Keys

Some newer formats, including Wii disc images, have encrypted sections. The
shell extension includes decryption code for handling these images, but the
keys are not included. To install the keys, create a text file called
`keys.conf` in the rom-properties configuration directory:

* Linux: `~/.config/rom-properties/keys.conf`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\rom-properties\keys.conf`

The `keys.conf` file uses INI format. An example file, `keys.conf.example`,
is included with the shell extension. This file has a list of all supported
keys, with placeholders instead of the actual key data. For example, a
`keys.conf` file with the supported keys for Wii looks like this:

```
[Keys]
rvl-common=[Wii common key]
rvl-korean=[Wii Korean key]
```

Replace the key placeholders with hexadecimal strings representing the key.
In this example, both keys are AES-128, so the hexadecimal strings should be
32 characters long.

NOTE: If a key is incorrect, any properties dialog that uses the key to
decrypt data will show an error message instead of the data in question.
