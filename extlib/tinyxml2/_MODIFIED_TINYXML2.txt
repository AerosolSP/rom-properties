This copy of tinyxml2-4.0.1 is a modified version of the original.

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Non-CMake build infrastructure has been removed.

- The original CMakeLists.txt has been removed and replaced with a
  minimal version that only supports static linking.

- Test cases are no longer built and run.

- cmake_minimum_required() is disabled, since it interfered with
  policies set by the main build infrastructure.
